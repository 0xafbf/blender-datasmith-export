# Blender Datasmith addon

This addon lets you export your blender scene to UE4 using the Datasmith
format.

You can see a brief overview of how it works here:

The plugin is currently in preview status, you can try it by [getting the
testing source build](https://github.com/0xafbf/blender-datasmith-export/archive/master.zip)
and install from the blender addons preferences pane.

This is a work in progress, if you want to contribute to improve it, feel free
to submit pull requests or support me on Patreon:

This is an unofficial exporter. This is not supported by Epic Games. That being
said, you can still discuss about it and give feedback in the Unreal Engine
forums.
